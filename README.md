# Hospital Room Tracking App

The goal of this project is to create an application that allows for easier communication between nurses and housekeepers. A visual display contains the status of rooms for nurses and housekeepers to see. The receptionist is able to create rooms and add patients into rooms. A timer begins whenever a housekeeper starts cleaning a room so nurses are able to know when a room will become available again.

#  OSU Winter Hackathon 2023

This project was made for the Oregon State University winter hackathon. The main inspiration for the project came from one of our group members, Hannah, who works in a hospital setting.  From Hannah's experience, there is an underlying issue in the communication system between nurses and housekeeping. We created this GUI application to help with that. The project recieved third place in the New Student category.
